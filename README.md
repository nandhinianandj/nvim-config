# Introduction

This is my Neovim configuration for all the platforms I use (Linux, Windows and
macOS). `init.vim` is the config file for terminal Neovim, and `ginit.vim` is
the additional config file for GUI client of Neovim (I am using
[neovim-qt](https://github.com/equalsraf/neovim-qt) for now on Windows).

My configurations are heavily documented to make it as clear as possible. While
you can download the whole repository and use it, it is not recommended though.
Good configurations are personal. Everyone should have his or her unique config
file. You are encouraged to copy from this this repo the part you feel useful
and add it to your own Nvim config.

See [doc here](docs/README.md) on how to install Nvim's dependencies, Nvim
itself and the configuration on different platforms (Linux, macOS and Windows).

# Trouble shooting

If you come across an issue, you can first use `:checkhealth` command provided
by `nvim` to trouble-shoot yourself. Please read carefully the messages
provided by health check.

If you still have an issue, you may [open a new issue](https://github.com/jdhao/nvim-config/issues).
